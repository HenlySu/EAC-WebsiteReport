            <h3>Discussion of Solution or Options</h3>

            <p>
               For our goal, we put forward three plans in total. The first plan 
               is to replace the incandescent bulbs in the school with LED bulbs 
               that consume less energy, reducing carbon dioxide emissions and 
               saving energy. This involves the checking of old light bulbs and 
               the installation of new LED light bulbs.
            </p>
            <p>
               The second option is the installation of solar panels on the rooftop or 
               large surfaces and using them to provide energy for specific features and 
               parts of the school. Solar energy is a clean energy source that is more 
               environmentally friendly than many energy sources.
            </p>
            <p>
               Lastly, the final solution our team proposes is establishing a club with tree 
               planting as the main activity, using trees to absorb carbon dioxide, and 
               promoting environmental protection as a secondary activity. In addition to 
               the intention of reducing greenhouse gas, the proposal also aims to increase 
               public awareness. To achieve this, we will activate and attract attention by 
               doing activities like spring planting and updates on the Green Club website. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Under a few considerations and discussions of the advantages and disadvantages, 
               our team has chosen the solution with the highest feasibility:
            </p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  With the narrowing of choices, our team is more able to focus on the solution 
                  providing detailed and more diverse research concerning the solution.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Under different circumstances, our team focuses on the best environmental, low-cost, 
                  and efficient selection.
               </li>
               <li>
                  The narrowing down of choice matches the field of experts of our members.
               </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
               Hence, discovering the team members' potential to the greatest and using their professional 
               skills to the finest.
