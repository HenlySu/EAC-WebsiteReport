               In summary, the first solution, LED lamps, saves more energy than incandescent 
               lamps, reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Furthermore, in the long run, LED 
               lights have a longer lifespan and are more cost-effective. However, LED 
               bulbs are also significantly more expensive than incandescent bulbs, and 
               purchasing and installing them can stretch the budget. Next is the second 
               solution, which uses solar energy to provide energy. This is a sustainable 
               and clean energy source, but its use cost is too expensive. The installation 
               cost alone is staggering enough, not to mention the subsequent maintenance.

               Moreover, considering that Toronto is not sunny, it is hard to say whether 
               the expected effect will be achieved. The third solution has not only many 
               benefits but also remarkable effects. The downside is that this solution 
               requires much staffing and additional costs in the initial stage, and the 
               website also needs to be managed by someone, all of which we need to consider. 
               However, continuing and scaling up tree-planting efforts can be essential in 
               mitigating greenhouse gas emissions for current and future generations. Seneca 
               can contribute to this effort by supporting and participating in tree-planting 
               initiatives and advocating for policies that promote afforestation and reforestation. 
               Harnessing the full potential of trees in mitigating greenhouse gas emissions is a 
               critical component of achieving sustainable goals at Seneca. Under consideration, 
               the team has decided on the third option.
