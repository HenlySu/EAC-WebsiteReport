               The objective of the final recommendation is to create a green 
               club with the primary intention of raising public awareness. 
               There are a few unavoidable constraints while progressing with 
               the project:
            </p>

            <ul>
               <li>
                  The direct cost to activate the green club includes but is not 
                  limited to material expenses, salary expenses, and transportation 
                  expenses.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Recruiting biotic experts to function the club and providing professional 
                  advice is necessary.
               </li>
               <li>
                  Lastly, the maintenance of operating the website of the green club.
               </li>
            </ul>

            <p>
               Including the management of human resources and volunteers of the green club. 
               Specifically scheduling meetings and planning the road map of the club.
            </p>

            <h1>Infographic</h1>
            <p>
               A numerical value or specific rating value calculates the above constraints. 
               The maximum cost of operation is limited to $50000, including the cost of 
               purchasing the materials and non-material costs such as technical stuff to 
               maintain the website and recruiting biotic experts. We will minimize waste 
               and unnecessary expenses with the detailed calculation of the expected 
               required essential material.
            </p>

               The Rating values are as follows. Reaching a milestone of 100, 500 and, 
               1000, 5000 trees in the future. (Infographic) The number of volunteers 
               registered in the club. Listed and organized. Reaching a milestone of 
               volunteers in 3 months, six months, and nine months since the club was 
               created.
