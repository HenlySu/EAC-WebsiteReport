            <h3>Discussion of Solution or Options</h3>
            <br />

            <p>
               Our team has proposed three solutions to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions at 
               Seneca College, namely, the adoption of LED light bulbs, utilization of solar 
               panels, and establishment of a tree-planting club through a dedicated website 
               to promote environmental awareness. Technical aspects such as feasibility, 
               effectiveness, and cost were used to evaluate these solutions. Following a 
               comparative analysis, we have determined that all three solutions are viable 
               options for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Nevertheless, creating a 
               tree-planting club has been identified as the most practical and cost-effective
                solution for Seneca College in the long run. This initiative involves planting 
                trees each spring to absorb carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere, 
                improve air quality, promote biodiversity, and enhance sustainability. Despite 
                the high initial cost, this solution&#39;s effectiveness in mitigating greenhouse 
                gas emissions in the long run makes it the optimal choice for Seneca College 
                to advance its sustainability agenda. Therefore, we recommend that Seneca 
                College establish a tree-planting club as a promising strategy to reduce 
                greenhouse gas emissions and foster sustainable development of the campus 
                environment.

               <b>Option 1:</b> Switching to LED bulbs involves replacing traditional incandescent 
               bulbs with energy-saving LED bulbs, which can result in an 80% reduction in 
               energy consumption compared to traditional methods. This option is a 
               cost-effective means of mitigating greenhouse gas emissions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               <b>Option 2:</b> Utilizing solar panels entails transitioning from traditional 
               energy sources to renewable energy sources to support the school&#39;s power 
               system. This energy-efficient and sustainable solution can effectively reduce 
               greenhouse gas emissions.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               <b>Option 3:</b> Creating a tree-planting club and establishing a website aims to 
               plant more trees each spring and promote environmental awareness through the 
               integration of this initiative into a dedicated website. The potential of 
               trees in carbon sequestration, carbon dioxide emissions reduction, shade and 
               energy conservation, biodiversity conservation, as well as community 
               engagement can significantly maximize the effectiveness of mitigating 
               greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, it can contribute to achieving sustainable 
               goals successfully in the long run.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
               For our goal, we put forward three plans in total. The first plan 
               is to replace the incandescent bulbs in the school with LED bulbs 
               that consume less energy, reducing carbon dioxide emissions and 
               saving energy. This involves the checking of old light bulbs and 
               the installation of new LED light bulbs.
            </p>
            <p>
               The second option is the installation of solar panels on the rooftop or 
               large surfaces and using them to provide energy for specific features and 
               parts of the school. Solar energy is a clean energy source that is more 
               environmentally friendly than many energy sources.
            </p>
            <p>
               Lastly, the final solution our team proposes is establishing a club with tree 
               planting as the main activity, using trees to absorb carbon dioxide, and 
               promoting environmental protection as a secondary activity. In addition to 
               the intention of reducing greenhouse gas, the proposal also aims to increase 
               public awareness. To achieve this, we will activate and attract attention by 
               doing activities like spring planting and updates on the Green Club website. 
            </p>
            <p>
               Under a few considerations and discussions of the advantages and disadvantages, 
               our team has chosen the solution with the highest feasibility:
