        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          Seneca College, a post-secondary institution, has committed to 
          achieving sustainable goals from 2021 to 2026 and has already 
          launched various successful initiatives. However, the marine 
          ecosystem faces numerous challenges due to excessive greenhouse 
          gas emissions, including ocean warming and acidification. In order 
          to further Seneca's sustainability efforts and mitigate greenhouse 
          gas emissions, our team has developed several initiatives, including 
          conserving energy through heaters and air conditioners, switching to 
          LED bulbs and other efficient energy sources, installing solar panels 
          and rooftop gardens, creating a green club, and raising public 
          awareness through a dedicated website. After conducting a comparative 
          analysis, we recommend that Seneca establish a green club and incorporate 
          it into one particular website to raise public awareness about the 
          importance of reducing carbon dioxide emissions in our daily lives.
