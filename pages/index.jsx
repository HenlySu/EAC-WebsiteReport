        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          With the development of the global economy and the advancement of science and technology, sustainable 
          development has become more and more important. However, many problems have begun to appear when seeking 
          sustainable development plans. In order to deal with these problems, the United Nations has formulated 17 
          sustainable development goals with 169 targets. Among them is the protection of the environment. As a 
          postsecondary institution, Seneca College has demonstrated its commitment to achieving sustainable objectives 
          by successfully implementing various initiatives from 2021 to 2026. To further Seneca&#39;s sustainability efforts 
          and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, our team has developed several measures, such as conserving energy 
          through the use of heaters and air conditioners, integrating efficient energy sources like LED bulbs, deploying 
          solar panels, establishing a green club, and promoting public awareness via a dedicated website. Based on a 
          comparative analysis, we recommend that Seneca create a green club and incorporate it into a specialized 
          website to enhance public awareness of the significance of reducing carbon dioxide emissions in daily life. 
          This recommendation report comprises an introduction, a discussion of requirements and criteria, an analysis 
          of potential solutions, a comparative analysis, a summary of our findings, a conclusion, and a recommendation 
          section, all of which aim to provide Seneca College with effective solutions for reducing greenhouse gas 
          emissions in a sustainable manner.

        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The objective of the final recommendation is to create a green 
          club with the primary intention of raising public awareness. 
          There are a few unavoidable constraints while progressing with 
          the project:
        </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              The direct cost to activate the green club includes but is not 
              limited to material expenses, salary expenses, and transportation 
              expenses.
            </li>
            <li>
              Recruiting biotic experts to function the club and providing professional 
              advice is necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              Lastly, the maintenance of operating the website of the green club.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <p>
             Including the management of human resources and volunteers of the green club. 
             Specifically scheduling meetings and planning the road map of the club.
          </p>

          <p>
             A numerical value or specific rating value calculates the above constraints. 
             The maximum cost of operation is limited to $50,000.00, including the cost of 
             purchasing the materials and non-material costs such as technical stuff to 
             maintain the website and recruiting biotic experts. We will minimize waste 
             and unnecessary expenses with the detailed calculation of the expected 
             required essential material.
          </p>

          <p>
             The Rating values are as follows. Reaching a milestone of 100, 500 and, 
             1000, 5000 trees in the future. The number of volunteers registered in the club. 
             Listed and organized. Reaching a milestone of volunteers in 3 months, six months, 
             and nine months since the club was created.
