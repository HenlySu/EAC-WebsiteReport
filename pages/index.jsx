        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <br />
        <p>
          The global economy&#39;s rapid growth has given rise to numerous challenges for the 
          marine ecosystem, including ocean acidification and warming, which are further 
          compounded by significant greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to the ongoing 
          climate change and global warming phenomenon. To tackle these environmental 
          concerns, the United Nations has formulated 17 sustainable development goals with 
          169 targets. As a post-secondary institution, Seneca College has demonstrated its 
          commitment to achieving sustainable objectives by successfully implementing 
          various initiatives from 2021 to 2026. To further Seneca&#39;s sustainability efforts 
          and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions, our team has developed several measures, 
          such as conserving energy through the use of heaters and air conditioners, 
          integrating efficient energy sources like LED bulbs, deploying solar panels, 
          establishing a green club, and promoting public awareness via a dedicated website. 
          Based on a comparative analysis, we recommend that Seneca create a green club and 
          incorporate it into a specialized website to enhance public awareness of the 
          significance of reducing carbon dioxide emissions in daily life. This recommendation 
          report comprises an introduction, a discussion of requirements and criteria, an 
          analysis of potential solutions, a comparative analysis, a summary of our findings, a 
          conclusion, and a recommendation section, all of which aim to provide Seneca College with 
          effective solutions for reducing greenhouse gas emissions in a sustainable manner.
